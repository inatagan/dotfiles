# Terminal emulator window titles
# If you SSH into a host in a tmux window, you will notice the window 
# title of your terminal emulator remains to be user@localhost rather 
# than user@server. To allow the title bar to adapt to whatever host 
# you connect to, set the following in ~/.tmux.conf 
set -g set-titles on
set -g set-titles-string "#T"

# Friendly pane splitting
# The default key-binding for splitting a pane vertically is Ctrl+b % and 
# for splitting a pane horizontally is Ctrl+b ". That can be difficult to 
# type depending of your keyboard layout and it is also hard to remember.
# A more friendly key-binding is to use Ctrl+b h for splitting horizontally 
# and Ctrl+b v for splitting a pane vertically, it is also very convenient 
# to remember. To make this change, add these lines in ~/.tmux.conf: 
# More friendly split pane
bind-key v split-window -h
bind-key h split-window -v

# Mouse scrolling
# Note: This interferes with selection buffer copying and pasting. 
# To copy/paste to/from the selection buffer hold the shift key.
# If you want to scroll with your mouse wheel, ensure mode-mouse is on 
# in .tmux.conf 
set -g mouse on
# You can set scroll History with:
set -g history-limit 30000
# For mouse wheel scrolling as from tmux 2.1 try adding one or both of 
# these to ~/.tmux.conf
bind -T root WheelUpPane   if-shell -F -t = "#{alternate_on}" "send-keys -M" "select-pane -t =; copy-mode -e; send-keys -M"
bind -T root WheelDownPane if-shell -F -t = "#{alternate_on}" "send-keys -M" "select-pane -t =; send-keys -M"
# Though the above will only scroll one line at a time, add this solution to scroll an entire page instead:
#    bind -t vi-copy    WheelUpPane   page-up
#    bind -t vi-copy    WheelDownPane page-down
#    bind -t emacs-copy WheelUpPane   page-up
#    bind -t emacs-copy WheelDownPane page-down
